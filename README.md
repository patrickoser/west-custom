To do:
    Setup auto-reply through gmail so that when you get a message from the contact form it takes in their name/email 
    and creates a custom message tailored to them asking for any attachments/files that might be relevent to their request.

    See if you can set up the contact form to display a better message when a form is submitted. Right now it just shows up as 
    a json object.
